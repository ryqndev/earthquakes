(short for Geophysics VISualization - but I've been calling it "jeeves")

What originally spawned from a simple idea to visualize the USGS earthquake data in three-dimensional space (as I couldn't find one with a pretty UI) has evolved into an all-encompassing visualization for all things geo-physical related.

## Inspiration

There are two main sources for the inspiration to building this - the first is: I use Cesium at work and wanted to create my own unique use case with Cesium so I could get more comfortable with the library and the second, more important one: I started taking an intro to oceanography class that I ended up getting really interested in.

Shortly after moving past the earthquake/fault module, I found that the next few modules were all pretty similarly related and could be visualized in the same manner: winds, ocean currents, gyres, etc and pivoted from what was an earthquake visualizer into a generic visualization tool for researchers.

## Attributions

Big credit to the Cesium team. I'm sorry I had to remove your logo (not using Cesium ion services) from the main page. Realistically, I'd keep the logo if it looked ...more modern.

Also special thanks to Professor Stinson at Irvine Valley College for spurring my initial interest in this field!
